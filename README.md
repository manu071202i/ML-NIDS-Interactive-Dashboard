# üõ°Ô∏è ML-NIDS: Machine Learning-Based Network Intrusion Detection Dashboard

An interactive web-based dashboard that showcases a Machine Learning-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. This project provides insight into the data, compares multiple ML models, visualizes key features, and highlights actionable insights into network vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

## üêç (Optional) Python Backend Setup ‚Äì Conceptual ML Pipeline

If you'd like to integrate or run the full ML backend (model training, data processing):

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-NIDS-Project.git
cd ML-NIDS-Project

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
# OR
.\venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add the UNSW-NB15 dataset
# Place dataset files into the `data/` directory

# Run the main script
python src/main.py
